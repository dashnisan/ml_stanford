Programming Assignments ML Course Stanford University with Andrew Ng

In this repository you find the code and the output for different assignmets for the course "Machine Learning" with [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
This course is not anymore offered as such but in an extended form as a [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?)

Currently available:
  1. **Linear regression**: programming of the algorithm itself using the gradient descent optimization method and also the normal equation method.
  2. **Neural network** backpropagation for recognition of numerical digits.
  3. **Regularization**: exploring underfitteing and overfitting with linear and polynomial regressions and regularization factor
